Student-Konnect
===============

The system is being developed to help secondary students with their subjects, acting as a study guide and step by step example for practical work. The advantage will be not to limit the program to one school but also have it run online where teachers can also edit the information and all schools using it will have access to the vast amount of information stored already having questions and answers, in return making it easy to make questions for testes and exams.
